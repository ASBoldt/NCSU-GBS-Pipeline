================================================================================
This program / pipeline was built as a tool for streamlining the processing of genotyping by sequencing data. It is a fork of the TASSEL software developed and made available by the USDA-ARS Lab with Cornell's Institute for Genomic Diversity (http://www.maizegenetics.net/).

This software takes two FASTQ files representing forward and reverse sequencing of the same flow cell and:
1) concatenates the forward and reserve sequencing utilizing the forward sequence identifier
2) feeds the outputs from step 1 to FastqToTagCountPlugin
3)
4)
5)
